# premiosplatzi

Just a simple backend created with Django. I followed the basic Django tutorial.

Find it here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/

This project has 3 branches:

* `main` -> The main branch of the project.
* `basic-state` -> A simple poll app. 
* `django-polls` -> The app in `basic-state` but packaged for distribution.

I tried Django for the first time. And love it!

I'll be creating my personal website using this framework soon.
